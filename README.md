# ðŸ¦‰ Bubo Reader

Bubo Reader is a somewhat irrationally minimalist <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> feed reader you can deploy on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) in a few steps. The goal of the project is to generate a webpage that shows a list of links from a collection of feeds organized by category and website. That's it. 

It is named after this [silly robot owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYSeCfo9-NI) from Clash of the Titans (1981).

You can read more about how this project came about in my blog post '[Introducing Bubo RSS: An Absurdly Minimalist RSS Feed Reader](https://george.mand.is/2019/11/introducing-bubo-rss-an-absurdly-minimalist-rss-feed-reader/)'

## Getting Started

How to use Bubo Reader in a few easy steps with GitHub and Netlify:

### Deploying from GitHub to Netlify

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss/fork)
- From your forked repository go to and edcit `src/feeds.json` to manage your feeds and categories
- [Create a new site](https://app.netlify.com/start) on Netlify from GitHub 

The deploy settings should automatically import from the `netlify.toml` file. All you'll need to do is confirm and you're ready to go!

### Keeping Feeds Updated

To keep your feeds up to date you'll want to [setup a Build Hook](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/#incoming-webhooks) for your Netlify site and use another service to ping it every so often to trigger a rebuild. I'd suggeste looking into:

- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com/)

If you already have a server running Linux and some command-line experience it might be simpler to setup a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). 

## Anatomy of Bubo Reader

- `src/index.html` - a [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template that lets you change how the feeds are displayed
- `output/style.css` - a CSS file to stylize your feed output
- `src/feeds.json` - a JSON file containing the URLs for various site's feeds separated into categories
- `src/index.js` - the script that loads the feeds and does the actual parsinga and rendering
